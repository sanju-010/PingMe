This is a P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Chat App built using WebRTC for real-time communication, combined with a Progressive Web App (PWA) structure for an offline-first, mobile-friendly experience. The app allows users to directly connect and chat with each other without the need for a central server, using unique Peer IDs for connecting.
